## The Process

For this project, I spent a lot of time planning the project out and it helped me reach the minimum viable product (mvp) very quickly. I wrote out my own Trello board from scratch and it helped to go step by step to conceptually understand the steps I would need to take to reach mvp. I worked on the backend first - setting up my routes and acheiving full CRUD on both the user and cigar modals. I utilized Postman to test that all the routes were working. Then I worked on the client side with React where I ran into a lot of issues. After lots of trails, peer input, and instructor guidance, I was able to get full CRUD on the front end. 

## Something Cool

Using ternary operators is a great way to simplify your code. For this project I used ternary's several times inconjunction with toggle methods to render different components. A very handy and cool tool!

## Final Thoughts and Version 2.0

Getting help after being stuck on an issue after awhile, talking through the code with classmates, and not letting frustration deter me from 

There's a couple things I wished I could've gotten to. 
* For the adding a Game page - I would've liked to add a calender that the user can see and select the date for the game. 
* Adding more styles to make the app look a more modern and user-inviting (maybe some images, more colors, more design)
* Consolidate the stats data into a table
